François Couperin, also known as *Couperin le Grand*, was one of the most influential French composers of the Baroque era. Born into a prestigious family of musicians, he carried the Couperin name to its highest point. His music seamlessly blends French elegance with Italian expressiveness, particularly in his keyboard and sacred music works.

He was appointed **organiste du roi** at the royal court of Louis XIV and served as organist at Saint-Gervais in Paris. He composed prolifically for the harpsichord, organ, and voice, creating music that is at once intimate, refined, and emotionally resonant.
